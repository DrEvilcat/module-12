# module-12

This repo contains two Jupyter notebooks.
Part 1 scrapes articles of Mars news and exports to a JSON file
Part 2 scrapes a table showing Mars temperature data recorded by Curiosity. This notebook contains several observations, and exports
	the end dataframe to a csv.
These notebook will require a functional internet connection to retrieve the data.

pd.read_html may require installation of the 'lxml' package to run in this case.
